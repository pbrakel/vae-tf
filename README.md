# Yet Another Variational Autoencoder

A simple VAE implementation in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

I just wrote this to get my feet wet with TensorFlow. It's not much code and
there are plenty of other implementations around but perhaps it can still be of
use to someone.

The code depends on TensorFlow, PIL for saving images and numpy.
